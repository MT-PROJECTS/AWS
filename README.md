# AWS Content now on https://mt-projects.github.io/ 
Had complaints from a few people about not being able to access the documents on Github.
So to make it easier for everyone, it is now posted on the site. 
Check under the AWS tab on the navigation bar for all the content.
The site is mobile compatible, so you can study on the go!
Good Luck!
