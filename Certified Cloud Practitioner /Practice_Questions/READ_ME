The following questions are taken from ExamTopics. It is a free website that has over 100+ questions related to AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. I had a few of the questions come on the exam when I took it.

Issue with their questions are the answers. On their website, many of the questions had the wrong answer. I tried my best to highlight the correct answers which is why I took snippets. 

If you think any of them have the incorrect answer, please let me know. I will make the changes.
Also feel free to visit their site. Each question has a discussion section where you can interact with others and justify why you think an answer is incorrect.

Good Luck!
